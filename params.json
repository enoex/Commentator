{"name":"Commentator","body":"### Commentator.\r\n\r\nThis is a code and comment analysis script that is designed to encourage \r\ndevelopers to more thoroughly comment code. \r\n\r\nRight now it's fairly simple.  It accepts Javascript / CoffeeScript files as\r\ninput, but eventually should be file type agnostic (comment styles will just need to be defined)\r\n\r\nTo call the script, call enforce.py and pass in a file name (either relative\r\npath or absolute).  e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python enforce.py test.js\r\n```\r\n","tagline":"Comment analysis program that analyzes code to encourage developers to comment more","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
