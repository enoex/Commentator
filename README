README
=========================================
This is a code and comment analysis script that is designed to encourage 
developers to more thoroughly comment code. 

Right now it's pretty base, but accepts Javascript / CoffeeScript files as
input.  TODO: Other file types can be easily added by adding definitions.

=========================================
To call the script, call enforce.py and pass in a file name (either relative
path or absolute).  e.g.

    python enforce.py test.js

    python enforce.py ~/Code/my_project/src/js/my_big_file.js
